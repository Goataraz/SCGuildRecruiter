# GuildRecruiter by The Shadow Collective
What this addon does:

Scans the game for unguilded players and displays them in a list for you.
Allows you to left click player names and whisper them with a recruitment message.
Allows you to right click a player name and add them to a blacklist.
Allows you to set 3 separate guild recruitment whispers to be randomly sent to players.
Allows you to filter players by race, class, and level.
Allows you to set custom filters.
Adds an "Invite to Guild" option to the right click menu.
Gives you the option to automatically welcome new members to the guild (enabled by default.)
Give you the option to autograts guild members for achievements (disabled by default)
This addon does not invite players to your guild. It will only whisper them.

 

--- Currently working on implementing a way to block outgoing whispers from showing in the chat window.

--- Working on changing the GUI.
